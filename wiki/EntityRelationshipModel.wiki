= Entity-relationship model =

According to our last discussion, I designed 4 entities(Category, Goods, Batch, Staff) based on our inventory system.


= Entity =


    *Category plays each category in this store.
    *Goods plays each goods in this store.
    *Batch plays each batch of goods into the store.
    *Staff plays each staff in the store.

= Relationship =

    *Staff is an independent entity.
    *There may be many Goods in one Category, and each Category has a unique `catid`.
    *One kind of Goods can be stored by batch, and each batch has its own expired time, count and price.
